My only advice is

RAM is the cheapest mistake you can make in a box. Especially of you can’t change it later. Go big or go home.

if you haven’t bought consider a x64 minipc as you’re looking instead of the Pi is bet you’ll find something that Outperforms at the same price.
my NUC blows by any of my Pi by orders of magnitude at the same price. Pi lost thier price/performance edge a long time ago.

RPi’s used to be cheap but that has changed and now new N100 systems are a good alternative.


For me one search on the forum for issues on pi5 answers that question VERY quickly. (lots of weird issues starting etc. I do not consider it a ‘tried and true platform’ compared to x64(X86) and HA is platform agnostic. Your backup will transfer.
