If you want an offline voice assistant in HomeAssistant, you would usually install the wyoming-whisper, wyoming-piper and wyoming-openwakeword addons. Since on TrueNAS HomeAssistant runs in a container rather than directly on a host, you canâ€™t install addons inside of HA. Instead you have to run these service somewhere else and then connect them to HA over the network.
