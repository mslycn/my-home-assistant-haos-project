Install Piper and go to the Configuration tab. The first option is “Voice”. Select the voice that you want from the list, preferably one with “-low” at the end, since these are the faster models. Some languages also have the option of an “-x_low” voice, but if you speak English, that is not available to you. Remember which voice you chose, as you will need this later on. Save the configuration and start the add-on.
